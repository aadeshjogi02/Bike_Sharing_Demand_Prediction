# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction

##### Bike-sharing systems have gained popularity and became an integral part of sustainable urban transportation in India, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional modes of travel. Predicting bike demand is essential for efficient management of resources and enhancing user satisfaction. This study explores the predictive modeling of bike sharing demand in India using machine learning techniques, focusing on a comprehensive analysis of bike usage patterns specific to the Indian context. The dataset utilized in this study consists of bike rental records, weather data, and temporal attributes gathered from bike-sharing systems across various cities in India. This dataset provides insights about the factors influencing bike sharing demand in India, including weather conditions, day of the week, and seasonal variations. Data preprocessing techniques are employed to address missing values and format categorical variables, ensuring the dataset is suitable for analysis. Exploratory data analysis reveals significant trends in the dataset, such as higher demand on weekdays and seasonal fluctuations. Several ML models, such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, ANOVA, and SVM, are trained and evaluated to predict bike demand. Model performance is assessed using metrics like R-squared and mean absolute error, providing insights into the effectiveness of various models in predicting bike usage patterns in India. The results indicate that machine learning models, particularly Decision Tree Regressor, are effective in predicting bike sharing demand in India, achieving an R-squared value of 99% on the test data. These findings can assist bike-sharing operators and urban planners in India in optimizing bike allocation, improving service quality, and promoting sustainable urban transportation practices. The study examines the fruitfulness of machine learning models in predicting bike-sharing demand in India. The findings suggest that these models can provide insights for bike-sharing operators and urban planners to improve the resource allocation and promote sustainable urban transportation practices.
